        <p class="fw-light">My credit score was 399, I didn't even know a credit score could be that low. I needed a
          apartment, but no one would approve me (obviously). After talking to an agent I knew this was the way to go. I
          submitted my information and was told I qualified. 2 weeks later I was approved.</p>

        <p class="fw-light">Me and my mother had messed up credit. She had an eviction and I just had very bad credit
          and we kept getting denied. I was very skeptical at first b/c I found the service on Craigslist. It took about
          a month before we felt comfortable enough to pay for the service. My mom did it first and then I did it about
          a week later. I know I got on her nerves with all the questions (LOL), but we just didn't want to do anything
          wrong. It worked and I felt so relieved. </p>

        <p class="fw-regular">January 04, 2016</p>
        <p class="fw-light">I was living in a hotel for 2 months paying $300 a week. I came across the add on CL, and I
          decided to take a risk. I mean, I had 3 evictions and was living in a hotel with my 3 kids... I had nothing to
          loose. I decided to go with one of the apartments on the list Elizabeth provided and was approved on the same
          day. I'm so grateful for this service.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mb-2">Tired of being denied</h5>
        <p class="fw-regular">February 13, 2016</p>
        <p class="fw-light">Every time I completed an application, I prayed that my eviction wouldn't show up. I wasted
          $400 being stupid, but I was desperate. Then I came across this website on google, that said they could help
          people get approve with evictions on their credit. It took me a couple of days to get in contact with them,
          but when I did, I thought it sounded a little to good to be true. Don't get me wrong, they never made any
          outrageous promises, I just couldn't believe something like this existed. Although I had my doubts, I had to
          let that go and rely on faith. They said they would help me every step of the way and the did. This was a
          blessing from God, I was about to be homeless, and as soon as I was about to give up, God showed me the way. I
          just wanted to say thank you guys. You have truly been a blessing.</p>

        <p class="fw-regular">June 28, 2016</p>
        <p class="fw-light">My husband and I were in a weird place. We both had excellent careers making great money,
          but my eviction from five years ago kept us from getting a new house together. We were newly married, and we
          were not quite ready to buy a house, but we were tired of living in an apartment. I saw one of their signs
          while shopping at the grocery store, and saved the number and called them when I returned home that evening. I
          don’t remember which agent I spoke with, but she made me feel safe… But what really sold me was the fact that
          they used PayPal and offered a money back guarantee. This may sound small, but it made me feel like they are
          serious about their business. Any who… I paid for the service, we applied a month later and got approved. I
          would advise anyone who’s having difficulties with evictions to take advantage of this service.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mb-2">I GOT AN APARTMENT !!!</h5>
        <p class="fw-regular">November 13, 2017</p>
        <p class="fw-light">I was embarrassed to admit I had 4, that’s right 4 evictions. No one would rent to me. My
          medical condition kept me in and out of the hospital so I would get a job and loose it just as fast. I
          understood why I was constantly getting denied, I wouldn’t rent to me either. But I have 3 children to provide
          for so I had to do something. Once I received a clean bill of health and was working consistently for 6
          months, I decided to give it a try. My cousin used this service before so I knew it worked. But I took forever
          to pay because I was being cheap. Meanwhile, I’m wasting hundreds of dollars on application fees praying for a
          miracle. Dumb! I finally paid, and five days later I had a new place.</p>

        <p class="fw-regular">May 30, 2017</p>
        <p class="fw-light">I thought this was some BS, I never heard of such a service, so I thought it wasn’t real.
          But I was wrong. It didn’t get approved for my first apartment and I was very disappointed because I loved the
          apartment. But the second application went through smoothly.</p>
